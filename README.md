Linch is a simplistic non-recursive link validator.

## Usage

``` shell
echo README.md | linch
find ../notes | linch
```

Linch check on filepaths that are passed on standard input. This way it can easily be composed with other command line tools.
Passed directories are ignored silently and not checked.

``` shell
fd | linch --sed-mode | parallel -j1
```

Linch offers a special *sed-mode* in which it outputs [sed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed) commands to fix permanent redirects in your local files.
Many sed commands may edit the same file so ensure that they are always run sequentially.
